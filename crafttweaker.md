# CraftingGenerator
This is some scripts to help make Craft Tweaker easier to work with. I will write in notes what to do best I can. 
Crafttweaker is powerful, but there's some extra unneeded manual work that has to be done if you want stuff done.
So I'm going to leave some of code I'm working on as reference so that if someone finds it, hopefully it'll help.
